Introductory game project for Unreal Engine 4.

**NOTE: maps are committed with no precomputed lighting.** To build static lightmaps: open the map, go to Settings > World Settings > Lightmass > [Advanced] > unset Force No Precomputed Lighting, then Build.

**NOTE**: The "_Starter Content_" package has been added to `.gitignore` as it is automatically added by UE4 on load, so don't modify its content as changes will be lost.
